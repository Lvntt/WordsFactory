# WordsFactory

WordsFactory is a project that was made as a second laboratory work of the advanced Modern Android Development course while studying in TSU, HITs.

With WordsFactory, you can:
+ Find any english word in a dictionary
+ Listen to a word's pronunciation
+ Make up your own dictionary by saving words
+ Learn new words by taking tests
+ Receive daily reminders to take a test
+ See your own dictionary statistics on a widget

The application UI was made based on a [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/nQXOG7HmwS0361R1o13D6q/HARD-MAD-2024-Lab2?node-id=702-2288&t=IOGKkK4Duczy9wzr-0) file that was provided to all the students.
